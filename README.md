# One Food Risk Tool Prototype

This is the RShiny prototype for the One Food Risk Tool, being co-developed by [Cefas](https://www.cefas.co.uk/) and [CSIR](https://www.csir.co.za/) as part of the [One Food programme](https://onefoodcommunity.org/).
This prototype was demonstrated at the One Food Risk Tool workshop in Pretoria, South Africa, in February 2024.
The tool's purpose is to enable collation and visualisation of hazard scores across multiple food sectors.

The tool can be launched by running the file **one-food-risk-tool.Rmd**.
Instructions for using the tool are contained within the tool itself, under the "How to" page.

This prototype is an archive version.
The developer for this tool prototype is [Sarah Alewijnse](sarah.alewijnse@cefas.gov.uk).
Further tool development is being undertaken by the [AI/XR Group at CSIR](https://www.csir.co.za/artificial-intelligence-and-extended-reality).
